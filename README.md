
# Electrodiffusion Library

**Electrodiffusion** is a comprehensive Python library for modeling ion channel dynamics using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), score-based diffusion models, and multi-scale simulation techniques. It integrates physical principles with machine learning approaches to simulate electrodiffusion processes, predict IV curves, and analyze complex biophysical systems. The library is designed for researchers in computational biophysics, providing modular components for custom extensions while ensuring numerical stability and physical consistency.

This library builds upon concepts from Claude's code artifacts, particularly the integration of physics-informed SDEs (e.g., IonChannelSDE with autograd-based forces), score-based generative modeling (e.g., PhysicsInformedScoreNetwork with attention mechanisms), and multi-scale solvers (e.g., Mori-Zwanzig projections in MultiScaleSDE). It emphasizes reproducibility with default configurations, extensive testing, and example scripts.

## Key Features

- **Coarse-Grained Modeling**: Efficient representations separating protein backbone and side chains, with ion state handling (e.g., Cartesian to conical conversions for channel geometry).
- **SDE Framework**: Physics-informed stochastic differential equations for electrodiffusion, including custom drift/diffusion terms, variance-preserving adjustments, and extensions for protein dynamics.
- **Score-Based Diffusion Models**: Generative modeling of equilibrium distributions using VP-SDE, with conditional generation for external fields (e.g., voltage).
- **Multi-Scale Simulations**: Hierarchical integration of fast (e.g., ion fluctuations) and slow (e.g., conformational changes) dynamics, including memory kernels and implicit solvent effects.
- **IV Curve Prediction**: Computation of current-voltage relationships, conductances, and open probabilities from sampled states, with Nernst-Planck flux calculations.
- **Utilities and Validation**: Data loading/preprocessing, mathematical tools (e.g., PMF, gradients), topology constraints via persistent homology, visualization functions, and built-in checks for detailed balance and thermodynamic consistency.
- **Testing and Examples**: Comprehensive unit tests covering models, simulations, and utils; executable examples for quick starts and advanced demos.

## Quick Start

Here's a minimal example to simulate a simple SDE trajectory and visualize it:

```python
import torch
from electrodiffusion.models.sde import IonChannelSDE
from electrodiffusion.simulations.integrators import SDEIntegrator
from electrodiffusion.utils.viz import plot_trajectory

# Mock system (replace with real for production)
class MockSystem:
    def potential_of_mean_force(self, z, protein_state): return torch.zeros_like(z)
    def electrostatic_potential(self, z, E_ext): return torch.zeros_like(z)
    def position_dependent_diffusion(self, z): return torch.ones_like(z)

noise_schedule = lambda t: 0.1 + 10.0 * t
sde = IonChannelSDE(MockSystem(), noise_schedule)

initial_state = torch.randn(1, 6)  # [batch=1, dim=6: pos3, vel3]
integrator = SDEIntegrator(sde, method='euler')
trajectory = integrator.integrate(initial_state, T=1.0, time_steps=1000)

plot_trajectory(trajectory)
```
